#Documentation should include the following for all 6 emails:

* Company of Contact
  * "Captain U"

* Person of contact and relevant position
  * Trey Tomlinson, DevOps

* Date of contact
  * "01/21/2017"

* Outcome (ie did you get a response? If so, what happened?)

  *  Trey responded and let me know he would let someone know I applied for the position but that they were just acquired by another company and were probably not hiring.
