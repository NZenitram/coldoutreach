#Documentation should include the following for all 6 emails:

* Company of Contact
  * "Pagely"

* Person of contact and relevant position
  * Gordon Forsythe, Developer  

* Date of contact
  * "01/30/2017"

* Outcome (ie did you get a response? If so, what happened?)

  *  I found Gordon in a WebDevs Slack channel and reached out to ask a couple of questions and show interest in a position I had applied for via the Pagely website.
