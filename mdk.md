#Documentation should include the following for all 6 emails:

* Company of Contact
  * "SendGrid"

* Person of contact and relevant position
  * Margho Kirsch (MDK), Recruiter

* Date of contact
  * "02/13/2017"

* Outcome (ie did you get a response? If so, what happened?)

  *  I sent MDK an email about my application and some of the positions they have posted on their website. I did not receive a response and plan on reaching out again during this session.
